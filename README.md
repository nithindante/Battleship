# Battleship

Battleship (also known as Battleships) is a strategy type guessing game for two players. We used HTML,CSS, Javascript for this program

It is played on ruled grids (paper or board) on which each player's fleet of warships are marked. The locations of the fleets are concealed from the other player. Players alternate turns calling "shots" at the other player's ships, and the objective of the game is to destroy the opposing player's fleet.
